Liberals should mourn the passing world
Why apologise for what was the most successful international order in history?

Being a profound intellectual and so on, I am concerned that a line from Top Gun keeps haunting me. In the scene, a fighter pilot who has lost all confidence is bearing down on a target but refuses to fire, claiming that his angle on it is not ideal. His fellow officer is adamant. “It doesn’t get to look any better than that.”

Anyway, this reaches you from Singapore. No country on Earth profited more from the liberal world order that is said to be breaking down right now. Trade enriched an island that did not have the natural resources of Malaysia to count on. Global rules and institutions protected a small country as a might-is-right system would not. It is a good place in which to toast that passing world. 

Someone has to. The enemies of liberalism are one thing. They think what they think. It is the apologetic liberals, forever pledging to “do better” than post-cold war globalisation, as though it was distasteful anyway, who are harder to take. A false note in Mark Carney’s now over-discussed speech at Davos stands out. “We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn’t mourn it.” Why ever not?

If the world was better- or fairer-governed in another historical era than in the one now fading, do name it. The Concert of Europe in the 1800s, with its balance of empires? Pax Romana? There is a conservative case for the first few decades after the war, before controls on capital and immigration were loosened. (The foreign-born share of the US was under 5 per cent in 1970.) It doesn’t seem a mad shout. You’d have to accept millions of now-free Europeans being under the communist heel, though, and much of Asia needlessly poor. It is a mad shout.

To make the point another way, let’s repurpose John Rawls’s “veil of ignorance” for a minute. Imagine that you are about to enter the world, but without knowing which part of it. Roughly when in history would you choose? You’d be daft to say anything other than “around the millennium”, wouldn’t you? It is not just a matter of the technological comforts. It is also the era when you would be likeliest to be able to choose your government, and relatively unlikely to die a war-related death. If yours was a small country, it would have at least the pretence and sometimes the substance of protection against the giants via international bodies. 

One myth about Davos is that its attendees are free-market zealots, closing factories in Ohio via email as indentured servants read Hayek to them

The trouble, I suggest, is that liberals think that owning up to globalisation’s failures will encourage their enemies to admit its awesome successes. Just no chance.

For example, a liberal mea culpa is that “we” were responsible for the global banking crash. True enough, but don’t expect proper attribution for the preceding boom. In Britain, that means 63 consecutive quarters of growth from 1992 to 2008. Instead, the deal seems to be as follows. Economic recession: the result of human agency. Economic growth: falls from a tree.

The same goes for war and peace. The nation-building occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan really can be blamed on a glitch in liberal thought, which is its view of the world as “flat”, without cultural differences that need minding. Even if the west did not seek to “drop democracy from 30,000ft”, it did treat the countries it sought to change as almost blank slates. Mea maxima culpa. On the other hand, decades of relative world peace, all the dogs that haven’t barked since 1945. You’re welcome.
